Thank you for taking the time to review my submission!
This is a node.js web server. You will need to install node.js and Git Bash.
To start the server, open Git Bash and cd to this folder "cvent".
Then, run the command node server.js.
The server is configured to run on port 9000.
Simply go to your browser and navigate to localhost:9000.

Tested using node.js v4.2.4, but any version should work.
